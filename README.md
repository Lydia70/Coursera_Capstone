# Coursera_Capstone
this repository is created to complete the Coursera Capstone Project

The first week is an introduction to the capstone project. I created a folder Week 1 Intro, this folder contains my submission for the first week.
Check out my notebook submission for week 1: https://github.com/Lydia70/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Week%201%20Intro/Week-1-Intro.ipynb

In week 3, I practiced with web scraping, clustering, and data visualization in the Toronto neighborhoods assignment.

Finally, I finished my Capstone Project in week 5, the battle of the neighborhoods in Vancouver. What is the best Vancouver neighborhood to live in?
